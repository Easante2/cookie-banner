          3.1 A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is
          sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is then
          sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server.<br />

          expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed.<br />
